## Project title: CyFile
## Project description:

- CyFile is a secure file/notes manager developed with the security and safety conscious
consumer in mind. It allows the user to securely encrypt and store data using a strong and
reliable encryption method directly on his mobile device. The app will be designed to
potentially offer all kinds of storage options from passwords to personal notes to entire files.
- A simple but effective UI will guarantee a satisfactory user experience and overall shallow
learning curve for the app.
- It will begin with the functionality of creating and editing simple notes that are encrypted
and password protected. Afterwards it will expand onto others structured formats like
passwords, documents from the file system, etc. The goal is to provide the user with a
comprehensive encryption platform on a mobile device.
